**Overview**

This project delivers a data-driven exploration of employee performance, satisfaction, and resignation patterns using Python, machine learning, and an interactive dashboard.
It provides actionable insights into productivity drivers, workforce engagement, and retention strategies.


### Live Dashboard

**View the interactive dashboard:** (https://employee-performance-dashb.onrender.com)


### Objectives
Analyze workforce data to uncover performance and resignation trends.

Identify factors influencing employee satisfaction and retention.

Build predictive models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest) for resignation prediction.

Present KPIs and insights through an interactive dashboard.


### Key Insights

Employees with higher satisfaction scores and balanced workloads show lower resignation rates.

Frequent overtime and longer tenure correlate with reduced satisfaction and productivity.

Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieved reliable accuracy in predicting employee churn.

Key predictors include Satisfaction Score, Overtime Hours, and Years at Company.


### Dashboard Highlights

Department-level productivity and satisfaction visualization.

Correlation heatmap showing relationships among performance metrics.

Performance vs. satisfaction comparison charts.

Resignation patterns and confusion matrix of predictive model.

Feature importance chart showing key predictors.


- Note:
The Resigned column is an encoded binary variable —
0 = Active Employee | 1 = Resigned Employee


### Tools & Technologies

Python – Core programming

pandas, numpy – Data cleaning & transformation

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Dash – Interactive dashboard

Render – Web deployment


### Results

Revealed key behavioral and performance patterns driving employee outcomes.

Achieved strong churn prediction accuracy using Random Forest.

Deployed a live dashboard with interactive filters for department, gender, and tenure insights.
